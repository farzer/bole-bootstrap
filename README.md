### Environment
1. Download and install Node, which we use to manage our dependencies.
2. Install the Grunt command line tools, grunt-cli, with npm install -g grunt-cli.
3. Navigate to the root directory and run npm install to install our local dependencies listed in package.json.
4. Install Ruby, install Bundler with gem install bundler, and finally run bundle install. This will install all Ruby dependencies, such as Jekyll and plugins.

### Run
- `bundle exec jekyll serve`
- `grunt watch`
